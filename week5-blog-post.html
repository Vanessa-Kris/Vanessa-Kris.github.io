                <h2>Hi there!</h2>
<p>I am currently interning with Fedora on the project "Extend and improve NeuroFedora's user consumable artefacts".</p>
<h2>What is Fedora?</h2>
<p>Fedora is a Linux operating system. The computers we have at home are similar it has an operating system called windows, Fedora is just another one like windows just with differnt features. the operating system tells the computer what to do when you move the mouse or press a key on the keyboard. e.t.c . </p>
<p>So just like we have operating systems for phone like iphone and android, we also have different ones for computers like MacOS, Windows, Fedora Linux e.t.c.</p>
<p>Now to do anything more with your computer you need to have aplications just like whatsapp and twitter on our phones, on the compter you can have web browser that lets you access youtube, whatsapp e.t.c.  the process of adding new applications to your phone or computer is called installing.</p>
<p>For this internship program i make lots of applications easy to install on the Fedora Linux operating system.</p>
<p>I got this internship through Outreachy.</p>
<h2>What is Outreachy?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.outreachy.org/">Outreachy</a> is a program that organizes three months paid internsips with free and open source software (see explanation below) projects for people who are typically underepresented.</p>
<p>The program is mainly for women, transgender, gender queer, non-binary people, people of color, and people who face discrimination because of caste or tribe, men who face discrimination in the industry can also apply for the program.</p>
<h2>Free and open source software</h2>
<p>Is both free and open, where anyone is freely licensed to use, copy, study and change the software in any way and the souce code is openly shared that people are encouraged to voluntarily improve the design of the software .</p>
<p>Outreachy has vast list of projects to work on but i chose Fedora and i am loving the experience so far, and i am hoping even after the internship i will still be an active contributor to Fedora.</p>
