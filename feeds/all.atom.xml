&lt;p&gt;My core values are intelligence, growth and freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;most people really underestimate their brain power, but as for me I believe I can do anything I put my mind to! I wanna know more, explore and grow! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thatâ€™s where growth comes in, I value growth even in the smallest scale as long as you are making progress and not giving up !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lastly freedom! I believe everyone should be free to practice whatever, go into any field of choice as long as no one is getting hurt!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I heard about outreachy, an internship that welcomes total beginners that was a very good motivation and the stipends?? Free mentoring from professionals? This was definitely my chance to broaden my scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should definitely apply for the next round.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category><category term="Outreachy"></category><category term="NeuroFedora"></category></entry></feed>
