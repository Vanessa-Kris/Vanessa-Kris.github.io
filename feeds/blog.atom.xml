&lt;p&gt;This is about a journey of adventure, headaches, victory dances and learning!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What was my original internship project timeline?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Week 1-2: Learn the Fedora package maintainer process, and improve existing packages via pull requests to practice the workflow.
Week 3-5: Go over the NeuroFedora packaging queue and identify a list of tools for packaging
Week 6-9: Follow the Fedora package maintaining process, and submit packages for review.
Week 10: Follow the review process and make necessary improvements to submitted packages.
Week 12: Submit packages for QA, test them, update documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What have I accomplished in the first half of your internship&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would say being an open source contributor is the biggest achievement so far as this is my first open source project, also i contribute to an organization as big as Fedora. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this first half i've being able to package python spec files,make updates and even review other packages, learn more about git as i practice. Generally i think I and my mentor have already gone over list ðŸ˜„&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What project goals took longer than expected?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The projects I found most challenging was learning how to write blogs for non technical audience, but my mentor carefully took me through a session where he explained the bits of writing for a non technical audience and i'm sure with more practice i'll get better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also building some packages took longer than expected, but with some help of course i had my victory dance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What would I do differently if you were starting the internship over?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If i was to start my internship over again? well i wouldn't change much because i love my learning curve and speed, though some times it's challenging and i spend more time on projects than expected but my mentor tries to help me out and modify my timing to help me understand better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But... i think i should have started taking notes earlier as i forget alot of little details ðŸ˜„&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is my new plan for the second half of the internship?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan on making notes at every step and also timing myself to catch up with my given tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Outreachy internship has really been awesome, it gave me the opportunity to be part of a bigger community, to learn things i never knew about, to meet awesome people and become a better version of myself. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category><category term="Outreachy"></category><category term="NeuroFedora"></category></entry><entry><title>Week5 Blog Post</title><link href="https://vanessa-kris.github.io/week5-blog-post.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-01-04T20:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2022-01-04T20:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Vanessa Christopher</name></author><id>tag:vanessa-kris.github.io,2022-01-04:/week5-blog-post.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Think about your audience&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This should be an interesting one considering the fact i'm going to be telling you about my project with Fedora ðŸ™‚&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is Fedora?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fedora is a linux operating system just like everyother e.g Ubuntu.... or Windows ðŸ™‚&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What does Fedora do?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well... a whole lot i still don't understand it all :laugh: but we are taking baby steps right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What do I know though?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know Fedora packages softwares, you know like computer applications.  and yes thats what i do with Fedora. some bunch of smart people do all the coding and all i have to do is package it all together so it works on our computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why this project?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part I don't have to code, I can't even code to save my life ðŸ˜‚ and i love this project because i can do lots of amazing stuffs ummm let's say i want to watch a movie on my computer with VLC media player and i dont have it installed in my computer, so I need to install it using my terminal, i go on google and search "how to install VLC on fedora operating system (OS)". And I get that VLC is not yet packaged for Fedora! Great opportunity to be cool right? I get right into learning how to package for Fedora, won't it be awesome to be a able to solve a problem as big as that? wow Open source is cool i know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this projects helps users like us install/uninstall softwares (applications) using simple command lines on our &lt;a href="https://opensource.com/article/21/8/linux-terminal"&gt;terminal&lt;/a&gt; The walk with outreachy and Fedora has been exciting and thrilling, there's always something new to learn and my mentor is always there to answer my buggy questions ðŸ˜‚&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you Outreachy and Fedora for giving me the opportunity to contribute to open source. ðŸš€&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category><category term="Outreachy"></category><category term="NeuroFedora"></category></entry><entry><title>Everybody Struggles</title><link href="https://vanessa-kris.github.io/everybody-struggles.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-12-21T19:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-21T19:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Vanessa Christopher</name></author><id>tag:vanessa-kris.github.io,2021-12-21:/everybody-struggles.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Everybody Struggles&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;What am I really doing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RPM packaging with Fedora. RPM files are like zip files (compressed) composed of different softwares mixed to work together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's just say an RPM packager does the packaging so users can simply use a command line to install softwares e.g &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo dnf install fedora-packager
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Outreachy I did not have the slightest idea of what packaging was all about as a matter of fact it was completely new to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How it all started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scrolling through lists of outreachy projects, I came accross the NeuroFedora project and I picked interest in it because it did not require much (lol) ... I joined the Fedora community and jeez I was lost, everything was so new I just wanted to give up, but I saw other applicants curious and asking questions. So I decided to give it a try. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read the docs sent by our mentor (Ankur Sinha) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/rpm-packages-explained"&gt;RPM Packages explained&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well... I was getting a hang of it but not so much and gosh I was intimidated by how much my collegues were picking up already. I decided to write my mentor (private) and he replied! He led me to the open chat where I mustered up courage to ask questions about my uncertainties and within few weeks I was already packaging for Fedora. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting part is till now I "always" get stuck on projects and still seek help from my mentor and community members.  I've learnt through the journey that no one really knows it all but you can strive for mastery by consistency, openess, and willingness. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category><category term="Outreachy"></category><category term="NeuroFedora"></category></entry><entry><title>Introduction</title><link href="https://vanessa-kris.github.io/introduction.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-12-10T19:20:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-10T19:20:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Vanessa Christopher</name></author><id>tag:vanessa-kris.github.io,2021-12-10:/introduction.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is an introduction of myself&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am Vanessa Christopher (she/her) a Cameroonian, I am 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My core values are intelligence, growth and freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;most people really underestimate their brain power, but as for me I believe I can do anything I put my mind to! I wanna know more, explore and grow! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thatâ€™s where growth comes in, I value growth even in the smallest scale as long as you are making progress and not giving up !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lastly freedom! I believe everyone should be free to practice whatever, go into any field of choice as long as no one is getting hurt!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I heard about outreachy, an internship that welcomes total beginners that was a very good motivation and the stipends?? Free mentoring from professionals? This was definitely my chance to broaden my scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should definitely apply for the next round.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category><category term="Outreachy"></category><category term="NeuroFedora"></category></entry></feed>
