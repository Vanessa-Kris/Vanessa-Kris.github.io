&lt;p&gt;RPM packaging with Fedora. RPM files are like zip files (compressed) composed of different softwares mixed to work together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's just say an RPM packager does the packaging so users can simply use a command line to install softwares e.g &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo dnf install fedora-packager
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Outreachy I did not have the slightest idea of what packaging was all about as a matter of fact it was completely new to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How it all started&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scrolling through lists of outreachy projects, I came accross the NeuroFedora project and I picked interest in it because it did not require much (lol) ... I joined the Fedora community and jeez I was lost, everything was so new I just wanted to give up, but I saw other applicants curious and asking questions. So I decided to give it a try. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read the docs sent by our mentor (Ankur Sinha) https://fedoramagazine.org/rpm-packages-explained/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well... I was getting a hang of it but not so much and gosh I was intimidated by how much my collegues were picking up already. I decided to write my mentor (private) and he replied! He led me to the open chat where I mustered up courage to ask questions about my uncertainties and within few weeks I was already packaging for Fedora. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting part is till now I "always" get stuck on projects and still seek help from my mentor and community members.  I've learnt through the journey that no one really knows it all but you can strive for mastery by consistency, openess, and willingness. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category><category term="Outreachy"></category><category term="NeuroFedora"></category></entry><entry><title>Introduction</title><link href="https://vanessa-kris.github.io/introduction.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-12-10T19:20:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-10T19:20:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Vanessa Christopher</name></author><id>tag:vanessa-kris.github.io,2021-12-10:/introduction.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is an introduction of myself&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am Vanessa Christopher (she/her) a Cameroonian, I am 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My core values are intelligence, growth and freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;most people really underestimate their brain power, but as for me I believe I can do anything I put my mind to! I wanna know more, explore and grow! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thatâ€™s where growth comes in, I value growth even in the smallest scale as long as you are making progress and not giving up !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lastly freedom! I believe everyone should be free to practice whatever, go into any field of choice as long as no one is getting hurt!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I heard about outreachy, an internship that welcomes total beginners that was a very good motivation and the stipends?? Free mentoring from professionals? This was definitely my chance to broaden my scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should definitely apply for the next round.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category><category term="Outreachy"></category><category term="NeuroFedora"></category></entry></feed>
