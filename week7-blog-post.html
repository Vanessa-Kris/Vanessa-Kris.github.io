	<p>Hello there! and welcome once again to my blog.</p>
<p>This is about a journey of adventure, headaches, victory dances and learning!</p>
<h3>What was my original internship project timeline?</h3>
<p>Week 1-2: Learn the Fedora package maintainer process, and improve existing packages via pull requests to practice the workflow.</p>
<p>Week 3-5: Go over the NeuroFedora packaging queue and identify a list of tools for packaging</p>
<p>Week 6-9: Follow the Fedora package maintaining process, and submit packages for review.</p>
<p>Week 10: Follow the review process and make necessary improvements to submitted packages.</p>
<p>Week 12: Submit packages for QA, test them, update documentation.</p>
<h3>What have I accomplished in the first half of the internship</h3>
<p>I would say being an open source contributor is the biggest achievement so far as this is my first open source project, also i contribute to an organization as big as Fedora. </p>
<p>For this first half i've being able to package python spec files,make updates and even review other packages, learn more about git as i practice. Generally i think I and my mentor have already gone over list ðŸ˜„</p>
<h3>What project goals took longer than expected?</h3>
<p>The projects I found most challenging was learning how to write blogs for non technical audience, but my mentor carefully took me through a session where he explained the bits of writing for a non technical audience and i'm sure with more practice i'll get better.</p>
<p>Also building some packages took longer than expected, but with some help of course i had my victory dance.</p>
<h3>What would I do differently if I were starting the internship over?</h3>
<p>If i was to start my internship over again? well i wouldn't change much because i love my learning curve and speed, though some times it's challenging and i spend more time on projects than expected but my mentor tries to help me out and modify my timing to help me understand better.</p>
<p>But... i think i should have started taking notes earlier as i forget alot of little details ðŸ˜„</p>
<h3>What is my new plan for the second half of the internship?</h3>
<p>I plan on making notes at every step and also timing myself to catch up with my given tasks.</p>
<p>My Outreachy internship has really been awesome, it gave me the opportunity to be part of a bigger community, to learn things i never knew about, to meet awesome people and become a better version of myself. </p>
