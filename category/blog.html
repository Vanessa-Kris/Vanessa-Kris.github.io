                <p>Where I am so far is all thanks to Outreachy.
This is my first internship, my first open source project/contribution, my first real work experience and it's really been amazing how I've come to love the tech industry.</p>
<p>Fedora gave me the opportunity to learn more about the Linux distro. Now I make applications for the Linux Fedora operating system. I'm sure with a little research I'll be able to package for other Linux distros ðŸ˜Š</p>
<p>Thanks to my mentor <a href="https://twitter.com/sanjay_ankur">Ankur Sinha</a> I've not only learnt packaging, but also how to communicate better, I've learnt team work, I've got a better understanding of python and most importantly I have learnt there is so much I can do.</p>
<p>Through <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/">Outreachy</a> I've gained this awesome experience and I will not stop here.
I am open to work and improve my skill, I can work remotely or relocate if need arises, I can work full time or part time jobs, I can also work on team projects.</p>
<p>I'm really looking foward to more exciting tech opportunities ðŸš€</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>Hello...</p>
<p>Let's talk a little about Python and C</p>
<h2>A little back story</h2>
<p>So I was asked "what's the difference between python and C?" and I was like what?? I actually do not know!!! Then i did a little research and... let's find out what I learnt.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Python is a multi-paradigm language and C is a structural programming language. Python is a general purpose language that is used for machine learning, natural language processing, web development and many more, C is mainly used for hardware related application development such as operating systems and network drivers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Python has very fewer keywords and more English language syntax whereas C is far more difficult to write and maintain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Python is much slower than C, Python takes significant CPU time for interpretation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Python is a an interpreted language while C is a compiled language.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What is a compiled and an interpreted language??</p>
<p>Compiled Language 
Compiled languages are converted directly into machine code that the processor can execute. As a result, they tend to be faster and more efficient to execute than interpreted languages. They also give the developer more control over hardware aspects like CPU usage.</p>
<p>Interpreted Language
This runs through a program line by line and execute each command.</p>
<ul>
<li>Python is dynamically typed while C is statically typed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Static Typing
Static type checks are performed without running the program. This is done as your program is compiled. The type of variable is not allowed to change over it's lifetime.</p>
<p>Dynamic Typing
Python is a dynamically typed language. This means that the Python interpreter does type checking only as code runs, and the type of a variable is allowed to change over its lifetime.</p>
<ul>
<li>Python is a strongly typed language while C is weakly typed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Weakly typed languages make conversions between unrelated types implicitly; whereas, strongly typed languages donâ€™t allow implicit conversions between unrelated types.</p>
<p>According to Fedora Packaging Python packages have different requirements from C let's take a quick look:</p>
<h2>Python packages</h2>
<p>Every package that uses Python (at runtime and/or build time) and/or installs Python modules MUST explicitly include BuildRequires: python3-devel in its .spec file, even if Python is not actually invoked during build time.</p>
<p>Mandatory macros</p>
<p>The following macros MUST be used where applicable.</p>
<p>The expansions in parentheses are provided only as reference/examples.</p>
<p>The macros are defined for you in all supported Fedora and EPEL versions.</p>
<p>%{python3} (/usr/bin/python3): The Python interpreter. For example, this macro should be used for invoking Python from a spec file script, passed to configure scripts to select a Python executable, or used as %{python3} -m pip to run a Python-based tool.</p>
<p>If the packaged software invokes Python at run time (as opposed to running Python to build/test it), it might be necessary to pass flags to %{python3} to isolate it from user-installed packages. See Shebangs for details.</p>
<p>%{python3_version} (e.g. 3.9, 3.10): Version of the Python interpreter.</p>
<p>%{python3_version_nodots} (e.g. 39, 310): Version of the Python interpreter without the dot.</p>
<p>%{python3_sitelib} (e.g. /usr/lib/python3.9/site-packages): Where pure-Python modules are installed.</p>
<p>%{python3_sitearch} (e.g. /usr/lib64/python3.9/site-packages): Where Python extension modules (native code, e.g. compiled from C) are installed.</p>
<p>Packages MUST include the source file (<em>.py) AND the bytecode cache (</em>.pyc) for each pure-Python importable module. The source files MUST be included in the same package as the bytecode cache.</p>
<p>Each Python package MUST include Package Distribution Metadata conforming to PyPA specifications (specifically, Recording installed distributons).</p>
<p>Packages MUST NOT own shared directories owned by Python itself, such as the top-level <strong>pycache</strong> directories (%{python3_sitelib}/<strong>pycache</strong>, %{python3_sitearch}/<strong>pycache</strong>).
<a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/Python/">Read more</a></p>
<h2>C</h2>
<p>I haven't had much experience in building C packages so far but; If your application is a C or C++ application you must list a BuildRequires against gcc, gcc-c++ or clang. Those packages will include everything that is required to build a standards conforming C or C++ application.</p>
<p>Other languages Fedora packages uses for packaging are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ada </li>
<li>C++ </li>
<li>D </li>
<li>Fotran </li>
<li>Golang </li>
<li>Haskell </li>
<li>Java </li>
<li>JavaScript </li>
<li>Lisp </li>
<li>Mono </li>
<li>Node.js </li>
<li>Ocaml </li>
<li>Octave </li>
<li>Perl </li>
<li>PHP </li>
<li>R </li>
<li>Ruby </li>
<li>Rust </li>
<li>Tcl/Tk extensions.</li>
</ul>

                <h2>Hi there!</h2>
<p>I am currently interning with Fedora on the project "Extend and improve NeuroFedora's user consumable artefacts".</p>
<h2>What is Fedora?</h2>
<p>Fedora is a Linux operating system. The computers we have at home are similar it has an operating system called windows, Fedora is just another one like Windows just with differnt features. The operating system tells the computer what to do when you move the mouse or press a key on the keyboard. etc . </p>
<p>So just like we have operating systems for phone like iphone and android, we also have different ones for computers like MacOS, Windows, Fedora Linux e.t.c.</p>
<p>Now to do anything more with your computer you need to have aplications just like whatsapp and twitter on our phones, on the compter you can have web browser that lets you access youtube, whatsapp etc. The process of adding new applications to your phone or computer is called installing.</p>
<p>For this internship program I make lots of applications easy to install on the Fedora Linux operating system.</p>
<p>I got this internship through Outreachy.</p>
<h2>What is Outreachy?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.outreachy.org/">Outreachy</a> is a program that organizes three months paid internsips with free and open source software (see explanation below) projects for people who are typically underrepresented.</p>
<p>The program is mainly for women, transgender, gender queer, non-binary people, people of color, and people who face discrimination because of caste or tribe, men who face discrimination in the industry can also apply for the program.</p>
<h2>Free and open source software</h2>
<p>Is both free and open, where anyone is freely licensed to use, copy, study and change the software in any way and the souce code is openly shared that people are encouraged to voluntarily improve the design of the software .</p>
<p>Outreachy has vast list of projects to work on but I chose Fedora and I am loving the experience so far, and I am hoping even after the internship I will still be an active contributor to Fedora.</p>

                <p>Hello there! and welcome once again to my blog.</p>
<p>This is about a journey of adventure, headaches, victory dances and learning!</p>
<h3>What was my original internship project timeline?</h3>
<p>Week 1-2: Learn the Fedora package maintainer process, and improve existing packages via pull requests to practice the workflow.</p>
<p>Week 3-5: Go over the NeuroFedora packaging queue and identify a list of tools for packaging</p>
<p>Week 6-9: Follow the Fedora package maintaining process, and submit packages for review.</p>
<p>Week 10: Follow the review process and make necessary improvements to submitted packages.</p>
<p>Week 12: Submit packages for QA, test them, update documentation.</p>
<h3>What have I accomplished in the first half of the internship</h3>
<p>I would say being an open source contributor is the biggest achievement so far as this is my first open source project, also i contribute to an organization as big as Fedora. </p>
<p>For this first half i've being able to package python spec files,make updates and even review other packages, learn more about git as i practice. Generally i think I and my mentor have already gone over list ðŸ˜„</p>
<h3>What project goals took longer than expected?</h3>
<p>The projects I found most challenging was learning how to write blogs for non technical audience, but my mentor carefully took me through a session where he explained the bits of writing for a non technical audience and i'm sure with more practice i'll get better.</p>
<p>Also building some packages took longer than expected, but with some help of course i had my victory dance.</p>
<h3>What would I do differently if I were starting the internship over?</h3>
<p>If i was to start my internship over again? well i wouldn't change much because i love my learning curve and speed, though some times it's challenging and i spend more time on projects than expected but my mentor tries to help me out and modify my timing to help me understand better.</p>
<p>But... i think i should have started taking notes earlier as i forget alot of little details ðŸ˜„</p>
<h3>What is my new plan for the second half of the internship?</h3>
<p>I plan on making notes at every step and also timing myself to catch up with my given tasks.</p>
<p>My Outreachy internship has really been awesome, it gave me the opportunity to be part of a bigger community, to learn things i never knew about, to meet awesome people and become a better version of myself. </p>

                <h2>What am I really doing?</h2>
<p>RPM packaging with Fedora. RPM files are like zip files (compressed) composed of different softwares mixed to work together.</p>
<p>Let's just say an RPM packager does the packaging so users can simply use a command line to install softwares e.g </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ sudo dnf install fedora-packager
</code></pre></div>

<p>Before Outreachy I did not have the slightest idea of what packaging was all about as a matter of fact it was completely new to me.</p>
<h2>How it all started</h2>
<p>Scrolling through lists of outreachy projects, I came accross the NeuroFedora project and I picked interest in it because it did not require much (lol) ... I joined the Fedora community and jeez I was lost, everything was so new I just wanted to give up, but I saw other applicants curious and asking questions. So I decided to give it a try. </p>
<p>I read the docs sent by our mentor (Ankur Sinha) </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/rpm-packages-explained">RPM Packages explained</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Well... I was getting a hang of it but not so much and gosh I was intimidated by how much my collegues were picking up already. I decided to write my mentor (private) and he replied! He led me to the open chat where I mustered up courage to ask questions about my uncertainties and within few weeks I was already packaging for Fedora. </p>
<p>The most interesting part is till now I "always" get stuck on projects and still seek help from my mentor and community members.  I've learnt through the journey that no one really knows it all but you can strive for mastery by consistency, openess, and willingness. </p>

                <p>I am Vanessa Christopher (she/her) from Cameroon, I am 21, I love music I'm also a singer, I love exploring and eating. </p>
<p>My core values are intelligence, growth and freedom.</p>
<p>most people really underestimate their brain power, but as for me I believe I can do anything I put my mind to! I wanna know more, explore and grow! </p>
<p>Thatâ€™s where growth comes in, I value growth even in the smallest scale as long as you are making progress and not giving up !</p>
<p>And lastly freedom! I believe everyone should be free to practice whatever, go into any field of choice as long as no one is getting hurt!</p>
<p>When I heard about outreachy, an internship that welcomes total beginners that was a very good motivation and the stipends?? Free mentoring from professionals? This was definitely my chance to broaden my scope.</p>
